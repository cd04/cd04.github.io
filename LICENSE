The paper studied the problem of persistent query attack to probabilistic data structures that allow approximate membership check. The data structures include Bloom filter, Cuckoo filter, quotient filter and XOR filter. The attacker can access several versions of the filters in a series of updates (addition or removal of set members). Its goal is to confirm whether certain target elements are in the set. The finding was that for Bloom, cuckoo and quotient filters the attacker does not get any significant benefit. But for XOR filter, the attacker can be able to infer with almost certainty if the element has been inserted in the filter.

My main objections mainly are: (1) the advantage the adversary can get seems to be small. The false positive rate is usually small for those filters in practice. So the adversary is pretty certain the element is in the set if getting a yes. The persistent attack only reduces false positive which may not be important to the adversary. (2) XOR filter was designed for static set, not supporting addition and removal. So is it reasonable to say this is a vulnerability? I would doubt if anyone will use XOR filter for dynamic set, as the overhead for rebuilding the filter is probably too much (they can use another filter that supports dynamic set in the first place).
